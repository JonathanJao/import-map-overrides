# import-map-overrides
A javascript library for being able to override [import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) in the browser. This works
with native browser import maps or with the [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) polyfill for import maps.

## Motivation
Import maps are a way of controlling which url to download javascript modules from. The import-map-overrides library allows you
to dynamically change the url for javascript modules by storing overrides in local storage. This is intended to be used as a way to
allow developers to override individual modules on deployed environments where they cannot easily change the html file. You should
not use import-map-overrides as the **only** import map on your page, since you cannot count on everyone's local storage having
valid values for all of your modules. Instead, this can be viewed as a developer experience enhancement and dev tool -- developers
can develop and debug on deployed environments instead of having to boot up a local environment.

## Installation
import-map-overrides is used via a global variable `window.importMapOverrides`. The global variable exists because import-map-overrides needs
to be usable regardless of build config and without dependence on ESM modules, since
[once you use ESM modules you can no longer modify the import map](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/blob/master/spec.md#acquiring-import-maps).

You can install import-map-overrides either through a script tag:

```html
<!-- Make sure to put this BEFORE any <script type="module"> elements or any System.import() calls -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/import-map-overrides"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can use it as an npm package:
```sh
npm install --save import-map-overrides
# Or
yarn add import-map-overrides
```

```js
// Make sure this js file gets executed BEFORE any <script type="module"> elements or any System.import() calls -->
import 'import-map-overrides'; // this only will work if you compile the `import` down to an iife via webpack, rollup, parcel, etc
```

## Configuration
If you are using import-map-overrides for native import maps, no configuration is required.

However, if you're using SystemJS as a polyfill for import maps, you'll need to tell import-map-overrides to make a
`<script type="systemjs-importmap">` element instead of `<script type="importmap">`. To do this, you must add the following to
your html file, **before the import-map-overrides library is loaded**.

```html
<meta name="importmap-type" content="systemjs-importmap">
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/import-map-overrides"></script>
```

## Integration with other import maps
The import-map-overrides library can override a server-rendered inline import map, an import map that is loaded via `src=""`, or
any other import map. The key to making this work is to ensure that the import-map-overrides library is loaded **after** all other
import maps that are on the page, but **before** the first `<script type="module">` or `System.import()`. An override import map will
be inserted into the DOM, which will work great.

## API
import-map-overrides provides the following functions. Note that these functions are always put onto window.importMapOverrides, even
if you installed it as an npm package.

- `window.importMapOverrides.getOverrideMap()` - Returns the override import map as an object. The returned object represents the overrides
**that will take effect the next time you reload the page**, including any additions or removals you've recently made.
```js
const overrideMap = window.importMapOverrides.getOverrideMap()
console.log(overrideMap)
/*
{
  "imports": {
    "module1": "https://mycdn.com/module1.js",
    "lodash": "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.core.js"
  }
}
*/
```

- `window.importMapOverrides.addOverride(moduleName, url)`: Accepts a string `moduleName` and a string `url` as arguments. This will
set up an override **which takes effect the next time you reload the page**.

```js
window.importMapOverrides.addOverride('react', 'https://unpkg.com/react')
```

- `window.importMapOverrides.removeOverride(moduleName)`: Accepts a string `moduleName` as an argument. This will remove an override
**which takes effect the next time you reload the page**. Returns a boolean that indicates whether the override existed.

```js
const wasRemoved = window.importMapOverrides.removeOverride('vue')
console.log(wasRemoved) // Either true or false
```
