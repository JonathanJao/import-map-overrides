# import-map-overrides
A browser javascript library for being able to override [import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps). This works
with native browser import maps or with the [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) polyfill for import maps.

## Motivation
Import maps are a way of controlling which url to download javascript modules from. The import-map-overrides library allows you
to dynamically change the url for javascript modules by storing overrides in local storage. This allows developers to override individual modules on deployed environments where they cannot easily change the html file.

You should not use import-map-overrides as the **only** import map on your page, since you cannot count on everyone's local storage having
valid values for all of your modules. Instead, import-map-overrides should be viewed as a developer experience enhancement and dev tool --
developers can develop and debug on deployed environments instead of having to boot up a local environment.

## Installation
The import-map-overrides library is used via a global variable `window.importMapOverrides`. The global variable exists because import-map-overrides needs
to be usable regardless of build config and without dependence on ESM modules, since
[once you use ESM modules you can no longer modify the import map](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/blob/master/spec.md#acquiring-import-maps).

It is preferred to install import-map-overrides with a `<script>` tag in your html file.

```html
<!--
Make sure to put this BEFORE any <script type="module"> elements or any System.import() calls, but
AFTER all other import maps
-->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/import-map-overrides"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can use it as an npm package:
```sh
npm install --save import-map-overrides
# Or
yarn add import-map-overrides
```

```js
/*
Make sure this js file gets executed BEFORE any <script type="module"> elements or any System.import() calls,
but AFTER any other import maps that are on the page.
*/
import 'import-map-overrides'; // this only will work if you compile the `import` down to an iife via webpack, rollup, parcel, etc
```

## Configuration
If you are using import-map-overrides for native import maps, no configuration is required.

However, if you're using SystemJS as a polyfill for import maps, you'll need to tell import-map-overrides to make a
`<script type="systemjs-importmap">` element instead of `<script type="importmap">`. To do this, you must add a `<meta>`
element to your html file **before the import-map-overrides library is loaded**.

```html
<meta name="importmap-type" content="systemjs-importmap">
```

## Integration with other import maps
The import-map-overrides library can override a server-rendered inline import map, an import map that is loaded via `src=""`, or
any other import map. The key to making this work is to ensure that the import-map-overrides library is loaded **after** all other
import maps that are on the page, but **before** the first `<script type="module">` or `System.import()`.

## API
import-map-overrides provides the following functions. Note that these functions are always put onto window.importMapOverrides, even
if you installed it as an npm package.

### `window.importMapOverrides.getOverrideMap()`

Returns the override import map as an object. The returned object represents the overrides
**that will take effect the next time you reload the page**, including any additions or removals you've recently made after
the current page's [acquiringImportMaps boolean](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/blob/master/spec.md#acquiring-import-maps) was set to false.

```js
const overrideMap = window.importMapOverrides.getOverrideMap()
console.log(overrideMap)
/*
{
  "imports": {
    "module1": "https://mycdn.com/module1.js",
    "lodash": "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.core.js"
  }
}
*/
```

### `window.importMapOverrides.addOverride(moduleName, url)`

Accepts a string `moduleName` and a string `url` as arguments. This will set up an override **which takes effect
the next time you reload the page**. Returns undefined.

```js
window.importMapOverrides.addOverride('react', 'https://unpkg.com/react')
```

### `window.importMapOverrides.removeOverride(moduleName)`

Accepts a string `moduleName` as an argument. This will remove an override **which takes effect the next time you
reload the page**. Returns a boolean that indicates whether the override existed.

```js
const wasRemoved = window.importMapOverrides.removeOverride('vue')
console.log(wasRemoved) // Either true or false
```

### `window.importMapOverrides.resetOverrides()`

Removes all overrides from local storage, so that the next time the page is reloaded an override import map won't be created. Accepts
no arguments and returns undefined.

```js
window.importMapOverrides.resetOverrides()
```
